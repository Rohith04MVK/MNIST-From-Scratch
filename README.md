### The MNIST Dataset

#### The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. This is also called the "Hello World" of machine learning. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.[8] Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset. The digits were written by high school students and employees of the United States Census Bureau.

# The logic and concepts of working:

### Neural networks

#### The basic idea behind a neural network is to simulate (copy in a simplified but reasonably faithful way) lots of densely interconnected brain cells inside a computer so you can get it to learn things, recognize patterns, and make decisions in a humanlike way. The amazing thing about a neural network is that you don't have to program it to learn explicitly: it learns all by itself, just like a brain (Not really but yeah)!

### What does a neural network consist of?

#### A typical neural network has anything from a few dozen to hundreds, thousands, or even millions of artificial neurons called units arranged in a series of layers, each of which connects to the layers on either side. The first layer or the Input layer are designed to receive various forms of information from the outside world that the network will attempt to learn about, recognize. Other units sit on the opposite side of the network and signal how it responds to the information it's learned; those are known as output units. 
In between the input units and output units are one or more layers of hidden units, which, together, form the majority of the artificial brain.
